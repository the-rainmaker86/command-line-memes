# command-line-memes
This repo allows you to make memes from the command line. Images and gifs supported.

To caption images, use meme2.sh. In the command line, type the path to the script, followed by the name of the image, followed by the top and bottom captions (in quotes) 

For example, if the image you want to caption and the script are in your current working directory, type `meme2.sh image.jpg "this is the top text" "this is the bottom text"`

For gifs, use gif_enhancer.py. To use it, type `python`, then the path to the gif_enhancer.py (which is just gif_enhancer.py if you're in your current working directory), then the path to the gif you want to caption, then the top text and bottom text. An example is `python gif_enhancer.py movie_clip.gif "This is the caption that goes on top of the gif"`
